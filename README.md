We introduce the multitask optimization platform, named **MToP**, for evolutionary multitasking:

- 50+ multitask evolutionary algorithms for multitask optimization
- 50+ single-task evolutionary algorithms that can handle multitask optimization problems
- 200+ multitask optimization problem cases with real-world applications
- 150+ classical single-task optimization benchmark problems
- 20+ performance metrics covering single- and multi-objective optimization

MToP is a user-friendly tool with a graphical user interface that makes it easy to analyze results, export data, and plot schematics. More importantly, MToP is extensible, allowing users to develop new algorithms and define new problems.
